The following people have commit access to the Subversion sources. Note that
this is not a full list of RTMPy's authors, however -- for that, you'd need to
look over the log messages to see all the patch contributors.

If you have a question or comment, it's probably best to mail
rtmpy-dev@rtmpy.org, rather than mailing any of these people directly.
